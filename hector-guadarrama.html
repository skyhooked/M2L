            <p>Hector’s musical journey began at the age of&nbsp;9 with the viola, sparking a lifelong passion for music【432813116706992†L38-L40】.  By 13 he had switched to guitar, and at 17 he joined his first band.  These early experiences laid the groundwork for his future as a musician and producer.</p>
            <p>Based in Seattle, Hector owns and operates <strong>Mestizo Audio</strong>, a recording studio he founded in 2020 after years of experience behind the mixing desk【432813116706992†L42-L44】.  His dedication to crafting exceptional audio experiences shines through in every project he undertakes.</p>
            <p>When he isn’t producing other artists, Hector plays guitar with the band <strong>palettes</strong>, enjoying the thrill of touring and performing live【432813116706992†L46-L48】.
